# YLD Frontend Code Challenge

We'd like you to complete a short programming exercise, which we would prefer if you completed by using React. It
shouldn't take longer than 90 mins to complete. Hopefully you will find the
challenge fun!



Good Luck!

## Instructions

We'd like to implement you the following pin pad.

# Requirements
   * Buttons should work with either touch or clicks
   * The pin should be hidden except for the last number
   * Hardcode somewhere in the code right PIN (which eventually could be read from an API)
   * The pin is always max 4 digits long 
   * When the user inputs 4 digits the pin is checked
   * If the inserted PIN is correct the screen displays OK and the screen is cleared
   * If the inserted PIN is wrong the screen displays ERROR and the screen is cleared

## Bonus requirement
   * After 3 wrong attempts the pinpad locks for 30 secs, showing `LOCKED` on the display


## Design requirement
   * The attached image isn't a design, make it look nice at will
   * It should be used on Mobile or Desktop

## Notes:

* To save time we suggest you use a boilerplate for [React](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) or [React Native](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app), depending on what you're using to do your test.
* Please submit your solution, your `.git` folder, and any notes as a tarball or zip file and name
the file with your full name.
* Do not publish your solution
* Let us know how to run your solution and its tests
